# SIMPLE SPEECH RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING.
In this project, I've built a simple speech recognition cnn model for processing speech signals and transforms the wave input to text output.

Dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge).

## Training accuracy : 87.86% and validation accuracy : 87.18%

and Pretrained model available at [here](https://github.com/bala-codes/SIMPLE-SPEECH-RECOGNITION/blob/master/pretrained%20model/Pretrained%20Model%20-%20Audio%20x%2090_%20Accuracy.h5).
